# TASK: Build Persist Agent Snapshot & Restore System (MVP)

## Objective: Implement a complete enterprise-grade snapshot/restore system for LangChain agents with Rust core and Python SDK

## STEPs:
[ ] STEP 1: Repository Setup and Git Operations → System STEP
    - Discard current changes, checkout main, pull latest from https://github.com/xenoscale/Persist.git
    - Create new feature branch
    - Set up GitHub authentication with provided token

[ ] STEP 2: Project Structure and Architecture Setup → System STEP  
    - Create monorepo structure (persist-core, persist-python, docs, .github/workflows)
    - Set up Cargo workspace configuration
    - Create basic Rust crate structure with hexagonal architecture

[ ] STEP 3: Rust Core Engine Development → System STEP
    - Implement persist-core crate with snapshot/restore logic
    - Create hexagonal architecture with storage and compression adapters
    - Implement metadata schema and integrity checking (SHA-256 hashing)
    - Add local filesystem storage adapter and gzip compression

[ ] STEP 4: Python SDK Development → System STEP
    - Create PyO3-based Python bindings (persist-python crate)
    - Implement LangChain integration with dumps/loads
    - Create user-friendly Python API (snapshot/restore functions)
    - Add proper error handling and Python exception conversion

[ ] STEP 5: Testing Infrastructure → System STEP
    - Create comprehensive unit tests for Rust core
    - Implement Python integration tests with pytest
    - Add round-trip testing for snapshot/restore functionality
    - Create mock storage adapters for testing

[ ] STEP 6: CI/CD Pipeline Setup → System STEP
    - Create GitHub Actions workflow for Rust CI (build, test, clippy, fmt)
    - Create GitHub Actions workflow for Python CI (maturin build, pytest)
    - Set up multi-platform and multi-Python version testing
    - Configure automated wheel building

[ ] STEP 7: Documentation and Packaging → System STEP
    - Create comprehensive README.md and API documentation
    - Set up maturin packaging configuration
    - Add usage examples and integration guides
    - Create developer setup instructions

[ ] STEP 8: Integration Testing and Deployment → System STEP
    - Build and test the complete system
    - Run end-to-end integration tests
    - Create GitHub PR with all changes
    - Verify all tests pass in CI environment

## Deliverable: Complete MVP implementation with Rust core, Python SDK, CI/CD pipelines, and comprehensive documentation
