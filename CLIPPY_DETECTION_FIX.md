# Clippy Detection Fix

## Problem Description

The setup scripts had two related issues with clippy detection:

1. **Clippy Detection Failure**: The script was looking for `clippy` as a standalone command using `command_exists clippy`, but clippy is a rustup component accessed via `cargo clippy`, not a standalone executable.

2. **Bash Script Errors**: The install function had inconsistent boolean/integer usage causing these errors:
   ```
   ./setup-dev-environment.sh: line 344: [: true: integer expression expected
   ./setup-dev-environment.sh: line 350: return: true: numeric argument required
   ```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Incorrect Clippy Detection
```bash
# Old logic - WRONG
if command_exists "clippy"; then  # This fails because clippy is not a standalone command
```

The problem was that clippy is installed as a rustup component and accessed via `cargo clippy`, not as a standalone `clippy` command. The script needed special logic to check for rustup components.

### Issue 2: Boolean/Integer Inconsistency
```bash
# Inconsistent usage - WRONG
success=true          # Boolean value
success=$?            # Numeric exit code
if [ $success -eq 0 ] # Numeric comparison with boolean
return $success       # Return boolean as exit code
```

The `install_tool` function was mixing boolean values (`true`/`false`) with numeric exit codes (`0`/`1`), causing bash type errors.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Rustup Component Detection
```bash
# New function to check rustup components
rustup_component_exists() {
    local component="$1"
    if command_exists rustup; then
        rustup component list --installed 2>/dev/null | grep -q "^$component"
    else
        return 1
    fi
}
```

### 2. Updated Tool Detection Logic
```bash
# Special handling for rustup components
local tool_available=false
if [ "$tool" = "clippy" ] || [ "$tool" = "rustfmt" ]; then
    if rustup_component_exists "$tool"; then
        tool_available=true
    fi
elif command_exists "$tool"; then
    tool_available=true
fi
```

### 3. Enhanced Version Detection
```bash
"clippy")
    if rustup_component_exists "clippy"; then
        version=$(cargo clippy --version 2>/dev/null | cut -d' ' -f2 || echo "installed")
    else
        version="not found"
    fi
    ;;
```

### 4. Fixed Boolean/Integer Issues
```bash
# Changed from boolean to numeric exit codes
# OLD (wrong):
success=true     # Boolean
success=false    # Boolean

# NEW (correct):
success=0        # Success exit code
success=1        # Failure exit code  
success=$?       # Capture actual exit code
```

## Changes Made

### Modified Files
- `setup-dev-environment.sh`: Fixed clippy detection and boolean/integer issues

### Key Changes
1. **Added `rustup_component_exists()` function** - Properly detects rustup components
2. **Updated main tool checking logic** - Special handling for clippy and rustfmt
3. **Enhanced version detection** - Proper version detection for rustup components
4. **Fixed all boolean/integer inconsistencies** - Consistent use of numeric exit codes
5. **Updated final check function** - Consistent component detection across all checks

## Testing Results

### Before Fix
```
[WARNING] ✗ clippy - Rust linter [RECOMMENDED]
[ERROR] Failed to install clippy
./setup-dev-environment.sh: line 344: [: true: integer expression expected
```

### After Fix  
```
[SUCCESS] ✓ clippy (0.1.88) - Rust linter
Clippy detected successfully!
```

## Benefits

✅ **Accurate Detection**: Clippy is now properly detected when installed as a rustup component
✅ **No More Script Errors**: Fixed all bash integer/boolean type errors  
✅ **Consistent Logic**: Unified approach for detecting both standalone tools and rustup components
✅ **Proper Version Display**: Shows actual clippy version instead of "not found"
✅ **Cross-Platform**: Works consistently across all platforms with rustup

## Implementation Details

The fix handles two types of tools:
- **Standalone tools**: Detected using `command_exists` (git, python3, etc.)
- **Rustup components**: Detected using `rustup_component_exists` (clippy, rustfmt)

This allows the script to properly detect modern Rust tooling while maintaining compatibility with traditional command-line tools.
