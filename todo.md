# TASK: Build Persist Agent Snapshot & Restore System (MVP)

## Objective: Implement a complete enterprise-grade snapshot/restore system for LangChain agents with Rust core and Python SDK

## STEPs:
[ ] STEP 1: Repository Setup and Git Operations â†’ System STEP
    - Discard current changes, checkout main, pull latest from https://github.com/xenoscale/Persist.git
    - Create new feature branch
    - Set up GitHub authentication with provided token

[ ] STEP 2: Project Structure and Architecture Setup â†’ System STEP  
    - Create monorepo structure (persist-core, persist-python, docs, .github/workflows)
    - Set up Cargo workspace configuration
    - Create basic Rust crate structure with hexagonal architecture

[ ] STEP 3: Rust Core Engine Development â†’ System STEP
    - Implement persist-core crate with snapshot/restore logic
    - Create hexagonal architecture with storage and compression adapters
    - Implement metadata schema and integrity checking (SHA-256 hashing)
    - Add local filesystem storage adapter and gzip compression

[ ] STEP 4: Python SDK Development â†’ System STEP
    - Create PyO3-based Python bindings (persist-python crate)
    - Implement LangChain integration with dumps/loads
    - Create user-friendly Python API (snapshot/restore functions)
    - Add proper error handling and Python exception conversion

[ ] STEP 5: Testing Infrastructure â†’ System STEP
    - Create comprehensive unit tests for Rust core
    - Implement Python integration tests with pytest
    - Add round-trip testing for snapshot/restore functionality
    - Create mock storage adapters for testing

[ ] STEP 6: CI/CD Pipeline Setup â†’ System STEP
    - Create GitHub Actions workflow for Rust CI (build, test, clippy, fmt)
    - Create GitHub Actions workflow for Python CI (maturin build, pytest)
    - Set up multi-platform and multi-Python version testing
    - Configure automated wheel building

[ ] STEP 7: Documentation and Packaging â†’ System STEP
    - Create comprehensive README.md and API documentation
    - Set up maturin packaging configuration
    - Add usage examples and integration guides
    - Create developer setup instructions

[ ] STEP 8: Integration Testing and Deployment â†’ System STEP
    - Build and test the complete system
    - Run end-to-end integration tests
    - Create GitHub PR with all changes
    - Verify all tests pass in CI environment

## Deliverable: Complete MVP implementation with Rust core, Python SDK, CI/CD pipelines, and comprehensive documentation

## ðŸŽ¯ CURRENT STATUS UPDATE

### âœ… Q3 2025 Hardening Roadmap (Phase 1) - COMPLETED
**Pull Request**: #45 - https://github.com/xenoscale/Persist/pull/45
- âœ… Track 1: Workspace & Feature flags (minimal builds, optional async)
- âœ… Track 2: Async Core API (no nested runtimes)  
- âœ… Track 3: Common Retry/Back-off crate (unified implementation)

### âœ… CRITICAL BUILD FIX - COMPLETED
**Pull Request**: #46 - https://github.com/xenoscale/Persist/pull/46
- **Issue**: Fixed E0282 type annotation error in persist-retry test suite
- **Fix**: Added explicit type annotation `RetryResult<&str>` to test_permanent_failure
- **Status**: âœ… All tests passing, âœ… Clippy linting passes, âœ… Build restored

### ðŸš€ IMPACT
- **Zero breaking changes**: Full backward compatibility maintained
- **Production-ready foundation**: Enterprise-grade architecture established  
- **Build pipeline restored**: All compilation and testing issues resolved
- **Ready for Phase 2**: Remaining hardening tracks (4-11) can proceed
